# Project Overview

In this project, we'll predict tomorrow's temperature using historical data.  We'll start by downloading a dataset of local weather.  You can customize this to your own location.  Then, we'll clean the data and get it ready for machine learning.  We'll build a system to make historical predictions.  Then, we'll add more predictors to improve the model.  We'll end with how to make next-day predictions.

**Project Steps**
* Download weather data
* Clean and graph data
* Create a testing framework

## Code

File overview:
`
* `weather_temperature_prediction.ipynb` - predict the temperature





## Data

We'll download our dataset from visualcrossing, an American-European agency.  You can follow these instructions to download the data:

* Go to [visualcrossing.com](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data)
* Go to Weather data section and choose your desire location
* Select the time period,according to your choice
* Click on download button
* Under data format and section,output content type choose file as csv and click on continue
* Verify the dataset and click on continue
* Click on run query
* Finally click on download button, the dataset would be downloaded on system
* After donloading the data filter it and save the file in CSV formatt
